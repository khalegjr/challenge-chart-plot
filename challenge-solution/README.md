# Frontend Challenge for Intelie

I built the challenge solution using Typescript because it offers variable typing, interfaces and verification with Intellisense.

I choose to use the __react-chartjs-2__ package to render the graph because it is a React library based on __chart.js__, which is a library that is widely used in Javascript community and has extensive documentation. As well ass, I choose the __styled-components__ library because, today, it is almost a standard in the React environment.
